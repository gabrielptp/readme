Welcome to my GitHub account!

## About

In addition to the repository you see here, I also have some private repositories:

1. **Side Projects**: Personal projects that I work on in my free time. These projects help me explore new technologies and build innovative solutions.

2. **Algorithm Practice**: It is for practicing different algorithms and data structures. This helps me stay sharp and improve my problem-solving skills.

3. **Company Assessments**: Repositories containing solutions to technical assessments and coding challenges provided by companies during job application processes.

## Additional Information

If you are interested in seeing any of my private repositories, please let me know. Iâ€™d be happy to provide access and discuss the projects further.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need additional information.
